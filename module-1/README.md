# Day 1 - Module 1 - DEVOPS

## Watch Introduction to DevOps [here](https://youtu.be/SL6WQnTgPkc)

## Purpose : 
Move from Academic tools and get aligned to industry development tools 

## Problem this module solves for you

Most of the projects  developed in college are  done locally on laptop and shared using pendrives with team members. Testing of the project is also done locally on your laptop itself.  Issues like "mere laptop pe toh chal raha hai" is common in college but this is not how professional coding works .
They write unit tests for each programs , they are build ,test and deployed using Devops .

Professional tools like Git (code version control), CI/CD are used to develop the project collaboratively, test and also deploy it.

This mindset shift of using professional project development methods and tools is what this module will give you an exposure towards.
It is like shifting a player  from gully cricket to professional cricket , you need to know how to handle helmets pads and  the pitch and playground is all different .
