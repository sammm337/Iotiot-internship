SDLC Models and DevOps:
SDLC models define structured approaches to software development, with popular models like Waterfall and Agile. The Waterfall model follows a sequential process with distinct phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. However, it lacks flexibility for changes once a phase is complete. Agile, on the other hand, promotes iterative and incremental development, emphasizing adaptability, customer collaboration, and delivering functional software in short sprints. DevOps complements SDLC by integrating development and operations teams to enhance collaboration, automate workflows, and enable faster and more reliable software delivery. It aligns well with Agile by incorporating continuous integration, deployment, and feedback into the development lifecycle.

Git Workflow and CI/CD:
Git workflows involve a structured branching strategy to streamline collaboration and code management. The main branch holds production-ready code, while the develop branch serves as the integration point for feature branches, which are used for individual development tasks like features or bug fixes. Developers typically clone the repository, create a feature branch, develop their changes, commit and push the updates, and submit a pull request for code review and merging. CI/CD further optimizes this workflow by automating build, test, and deployment processes. Continuous Integration ensures that every code change is tested and integrated into a shared repository, while Continuous Delivery and Deployment automate the process of preparing and deploying code to production, ensuring rapid and reliable software delivery.
