1.AI vocabulary and components:
Artificial Intelligence (AI): Machines that mimic human intelligence.
Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI's ability to understand and process human language.
Neural Networks (NN): Layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) mimicking the human brain.
LLM: AI model trained on huge amount of text data to understand and generate human language.
2.Model Architecture and Components
Input Layer: Accepts raw data for model to process.
Hidden Layers: Performs calculations to identify patterns in data.
Output Layer: Produces final prediction.
3.Training and Inference
Training: Ai model learns patterns from data. It does so by adjusting the weights and biases.
The goal is to minimise the error in the output.
Inference: The process where the trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
4.Context Window
The context window is a setting that controls how much surrounding information the AI model considers when generating a response.
5.How to write a good prompt:
Clear instructions,
adopt a persona,
Specify a format,
avoid leading the answer,
Limit the scope
6.Hardware and compute requirements:
High Performance GPUs: Essential for parallel processing and deep learning tasks.
Large RAM: Handles big datasets and memory intensive operations efficiently.
Fast Storage: SSDs enable quick data access during training.
Powerful CPUs: Supports preprocessing and lightweight AI inference tasks.
Scalable Cloud Services: Offers flexible resources for large-scale AI workloads.
7.Operations modes
Training mode: Model learns patterns from input data.
Evaluation mode: Model uses it's knowledge to make predictions for new data.
Fine tuning mode: Model is trained on a smaller, more specific dataset to improve performance for a specific task.
Transfer learning mode: Model uses knowledge from one task for another related task.
8.CNN and DNN
(CNN): A type of artificial neural network that's used to process and recognize patterns in images and videos.
(DNN): A type of machine learning algorithm that uses multiple hidden layers to process complex information.
9.Model Checkpoints
Model checkpoints are a crucial mechanism to save the intermediate state of a model's training process.
10.Transfer Learning
Technique in which knowledge gained through one task or dataset is used to improve model performance on another related task or different dataset.
