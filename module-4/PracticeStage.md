In this module, I learned about the significance of proper etiquette and effective communication in a corporate environment. The lessons emphasized the importance of maintaining professionalism and clear communication to foster positive workplace relationships and ensure successful interactions.
To further enhance the learning experience, I suggest incorporating more interactive scenarios or role-playing exercises. These activities would provide hands-on practice and help learners to better internalize the concepts. By simulating real-life situations, learners could gain confidence in applying their skills in actual workplace settings.

The documentation provided throughout the module was very detailed and served as an excellent resource. It covered all aspects of corporate etiquette and communication thoroughly, making it easy to reference and review the material as needed.
The practical exercises and examples included in the module made the learning process engaging and effective. They allowed for the application of theoretical knowledge in a practical context, reinforcing the learning objectives and aiding in retention.
Thank you for the valuable learning experience!
