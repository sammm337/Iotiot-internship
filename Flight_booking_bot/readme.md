# Flight Booking Bot

## Description/Overview
The Flight Booking Automation Bot is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the flight booking process using Playwright. It automates tasks like searching for flights, selecting seats, and filling in passenger details, reducing manual effort and saving time. The bot ensures secure and efficient automation with user-defined configurations.

## Features
* **Automated Flight Search & Booking** – Users can define flight search parameters (departure, destination, dates) in input.json for quick and accurate bookings.

* **Task-Based Execution** – Each booking attempt is assigned a Task ID for structured logging and debugging.

* **Activity Logging** – Every step, from search to final booking, is logged in log.txt, making it easy to review and troubleshoot past operations.

## How to use the bot:
1. Install dependencies using: `pip3 install selenium playwright`
2. Run the bot using this command in the terminal: `python3 main.py`
3. The bot will redirect you to makemytrip.com
4. A pop up will open up, wait for it to close
5. The destination, source, departure date and return date will be added automatically and you will be directed to another page
